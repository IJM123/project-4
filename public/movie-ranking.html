<h1>The Best Bollywood Movies According to Insiya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobrara</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite bollywood movies because it consists of<br />
   love, comedy, adventure, friends, and family all in one. I've watched it<br />
   hundreds of times and can never get tired of it.
</p>
<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>This movie is a full comedy movie and it also has important lessons.<br />
   It is just a great watch overall.
</p>
<h3>Yeh Jawaani Heh Deewaani</h3>
<p>This one has been a popular one for a long time but I had just seen it <br />
   couple of months ago and let me tell you, it is a little similar to ZNMD <br />
   but also has its own story and I absolutley love it.
